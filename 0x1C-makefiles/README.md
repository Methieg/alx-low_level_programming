# 0x1C. C - Makefiles
C


Makefiles are a way to organize and automate tasks when doing development work. They are used to generate output files from input files,such as compiling a program from its source code, or creating an image from a set of images. Makefiles contain a set of rules that tell the computer how to turn the input into output. Rules can be explicit, which means the computer knows exactly what to do, or implicit, which means the computer needs to figure out what to do. Variables can be used to make the Makefiles more flexible, allowing you to use the same Makefile for different tasks.
