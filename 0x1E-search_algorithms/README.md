Search algorithms are tools that help to quickly locate specific items in large collections. They work by either searching through the entire collection linearly, which can be time consuming, or by dividing the collection into two halves and searching the appropriate half, which is faster and more efficient. This is analogous to searching for a specific toy in a large toy store, where using the right search algorithm is essential to finding the desired item quickly.

In this projecct ,different exercises were carried out to exercise the search.
